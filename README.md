# Tic-Tac-Toe
Python Tic Tac Toe Game with an option for a game of two against each other or an AI option to play against a computer. Using AI and pygame. 

## Description

The Tic Tac Toe game is played on a 3x3 grid. Two players take turns marking a square on the grid with their respective symbols (usually "X" and "O"). The goal is to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

This implementation of Tic Tac Toe allows for both single-player and two-player modes. In single-player mode, the player competes against an AI opponent, while in two-player mode, two players can play against each other.

## Features

- Single-player mode: Play against an AI opponent that uses a simple strategy.
- Two-player mode: Play against a friend on the same computer.
- Interactive command-line interface: The game is played by entering commands in the terminal.
- Error handling: The program handles invalid input and prevents illegal moves.
- Simple and intuitive gameplay: Each player takes turns entering their move coordinates.
- Win detection: The game detects and announces the winner or a tie.
